Process:
-Read in binary file
-convert binary to Instr
-Implement execution loop
-Print last item in stack to file and std::out



Exectution loop:
Switch dispach vs. threaded dispatch

Rust -> Switch
C++ -> Threaded

use a Makefile for this assignment (3 targets)
-Build
-Run (must be able to use cmd line args)
-Clean

Makefile should use cargo build --release

Switch:
	Think functional programing
